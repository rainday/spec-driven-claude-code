## What This Subagent Does

The PRD Writer subagent transforms product ideas into professional, comprehensive Product Requirements Documents. It excels at:

- **Strategic Analysis**: Market research, competitive analysis, user persona development
- **Requirements Engineering**: Functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria
- **Technical Planning**: System architecture, API specifications, technology recommendations
- **Project Management**: Implementation roadmaps, resource planning, risk assessment
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Executive summaries, technical specifications, user stories

## üìÅ Business Plan Integration

The PRD Writer can intelligently parse and leverage existing business documentation to create more accurate, strategically-aligned PRDs. This eliminates redundant research and ensures product requirements directly support business objectives.

### **Business Context Fallback Strategy**

When business plan documents are not available, the PRD Writer implements a smart fallback strategy to gather project context:

#### **Step 1: Check for Alternative Documentation**

If business plan documents are not found, the subagent will automatically check for:

1. **`claude.md`** - Project configuration and context file

   - Project description and objectives
   - Technical stack and architecture decisions
   - Development constraints and requirements
   - Team structure and roles

2. **`README.md`** - Project overview and documentation

   - Project purpose and goals
   - Feature descriptions and capabilities
   - Installation and setup instructions
   - Usage examples and workflows

3. **`package.json`** (for Node.js projects) - Project metadata
   - Project name and description
   - Dependencies and technology stack
   - Scripts and build processes
   - Version and release information

#### **Step 2: Project Initialization Guidance**

If no business context or alternative documentation exists, and this appears to be an existing project:

```bash
# The subagent will suggest running project initialization:
@claude init

# This will create the necessary project context files:
‚úÖ claude.md - Project configuration and context
‚úÖ README.md - Project documentation and overview
‚úÖ .claude/ - Claude project configuration directory
```

#### **Step 3: Context-Driven PRD Generation**

Based on available documentation, the subagent will:

**With `claude.md` present:**

- Extract project vision and objectives
- Identify technical constraints and architecture
- Map existing features and capabilities
- Align PRD with current project direction

**With `README.md` present:**

- Understand project purpose and target users
- Identify current feature set and gaps
- Extract technical requirements and dependencies
- Build upon existing documentation structure

**With minimal context:**

- Request additional information through targeted questions
- Create a foundational PRD template
- Suggest next steps for project documentation
- Provide guidance for business context development

#### **Usage Examples for Context Fallback**

```bash
# Scenario 1: No business plan, but claude.md exists
@prd-writer "Create a PRD for the user authentication feature"
# ‚Üí Automatically reads claude.md for project context

# Scenario 2: No business plan, but README.md exists
@prd-writer "Create a PRD for the reporting dashboard"
# ‚Üí Extracts context from README.md and project structure

# Scenario 3: No documentation found
@prd-writer "Create a PRD for our mobile app"
# ‚Üí Suggests: "No business context found. Run '@claude init' to set up project documentation first."
```

#### **Context Quality Assessment**

The subagent will assess available context quality:

**High Quality Context:**

- Clear project objectives and vision
- Detailed technical specifications
- User stories and requirements
- Success metrics and KPIs

**Medium Quality Context:**

- Basic project description
- Feature lists without detailed requirements
- Technical stack information
- General project goals

**Low Quality Context:**

- Minimal project information
- No clear objectives or requirements
- Missing technical details
- Unclear target users

#### **Context Enhancement Recommendations**

When context quality is insufficient, the subagent will recommend:

```bash
# For missing business context:
"Consider creating a business plan or product strategy document to improve PRD quality"

# For missing technical context:
"Run '@claude init' to set up project documentation and technical specifications"

# For missing user context:
"Conduct user research or create user personas to better define requirements"

# For missing market context:
"Perform competitive analysis or market research to validate product positioning"
```

### **Fallback Strategy Implementation Workflow**

When business context documents are not available, the PRD Writer follows this systematic approach:

#### **Phase 1: Context Discovery**

```bash
# Step 1: Check for business context files
- business-plan.pdf, business-plan.docx
- market-research.pdf, competitive-analysis.xlsx
- product-strategy.md, financial-model.xlsx

# Step 2: If not found, check for project documentation
- claude.md (project configuration)
- README.md (project overview)
- package.json (Node.js metadata)
- .claude/ (Claude project config)

# Step 3: Assess project structure
- List directory contents
- Identify project type and technology stack
- Determine if this is a new or existing project
```

#### **Phase 2: Context Assessment**

```bash
# Quality Assessment Matrix:
High Quality:   Business plan + market research + customer data
Medium Quality: claude.md + README.md + project structure
Low Quality:    Basic README.md or minimal documentation
No Context:     No documentation found
```

#### **Phase 3: Adaptive Response**

**For High/Medium Quality Context:**

- Extract available information
- Create comprehensive PRD with available data
- Flag missing information for future enhancement
- Provide specific recommendations for improvement

**For Low Quality Context:**

- Create foundational PRD template
- Request additional information through questions
- Suggest documentation improvements
- Provide guidance for context development

**For No Context:**

- Suggest project initialization: "@claude init"
- Explain benefits of proper documentation
- Offer to create basic templates
- Continue with minimal PRD based on user input

#### **Phase 4: Context Enhancement Recommendations**

```bash
# Based on missing context type:
Missing Business Context:
‚Üí "Consider creating a business plan or product strategy document"

Missing Technical Context:
‚Üí "Run '@claude init' to set up project documentation"

Missing User Context:
‚Üí "Conduct user research or create user personas"

Missing Market Context:
‚Üí "Perform competitive analysis or market research"
```

#### **Implementation Example**

```bash
# User Request:
@prd-writer "Create a PRD for our mobile app"

# Subagent Response:
"üîç Checking for business context...
‚ùå No business plan found
‚úÖ Found claude.md - extracting project context
‚úÖ Found README.md - analyzing project structure
üìä Context Quality: Medium
